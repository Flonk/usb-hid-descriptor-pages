# usb-hid-descriptor-pages

I typed out all the USB HID usage_pages so you don't have to.

These were basically taken from the [usb.org HID descriptor tool](https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-descriptor-tool), but I fixed some obvious errors in that tool's list by consulting the [USB HID usage tables](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_13.pdf). I left in most of the naming inconsitencies.

I can only assume a lot of these codes are vendor-specific and hardly useful but I included them all regardless. They're from the usb.org website so they can't possibly be wrong, right?

It's entirely possible that I overlooked a few values or put in some typos, use at your own risk.

I might turn this into a full-fledged USB HID validation tool eventually but knowing myself probably not.
